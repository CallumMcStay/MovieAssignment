# Movies and Actors App
I made this Movies and Actors App for my Semester 1 Year 2 Project

## Features/Main points
This app is a menu driven programme that uses loggers imported from Maven Repository.
It Has 7 main functions
- Add an Actor
- Add a Movie
- Assign an actor to a movie
- List the Actors
- List the Movies
- list the Actors in Movies
- My favourite Movies
It also has an exit option for when you want to end the program,
Currently there are 3 more functions that dont work yet but are for the system once its further developed

In this project I have 8 Classes so far, Main is sitting under the Kotlin folder
In the Controllers Folder I have my controllers
- ActorController
- MovieController
- MovieActorController

In the Models Folder i have my models for the Project
- Actor
- Movie
- MovieActor
and also have a utils folder with my UI

In the main class i have all my options with the functions to call the code from
so that it is all neat and not messy. For my UI class i have multiple functions that
allows the system to take in different types of varirables (including nulls) from the 
User.
In my Controllers i have code that the main calls to, this is so all my code isnt on my 
main page and it is easy to access.
In my Models folder i have the type of information i want to store on each model
which is also linked to my controllers so that they can work together and make my code good.
